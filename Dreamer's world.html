    Welcome to dreamer's world...
  </h1>
<p1>
 You are entering the mysterious and fascinating world of dreams, 
 where the rules of reality do not apply. <br />
 Dreams are stories and images that our minds create while we sleep.<br /> 
 They can be entertaining, fun, romantic, disturbing, frightening, and sometimes bizarre.

 Why do we dream?
</h2>
 There are several hypotheses and concepts as to why we dream.
&nbsp;<br /> <br />
 <img src="Images/why do  dream.jpg" alt="Picture of girl dreaming" 
   style="width:400px;height:270px;" /> 
<br />
  Are dreams merely part of the sleep cycle or do they serve some other purpose?<br />
  Possible explanations for why we dream include:

 <ul>
  <li>To represent unconscious desires and wishes</li>
  <li>To interpret random signals from the brain and body during sleep</li>
  <li>To consolidate and process information gathered during the day</li>
  <li>To work as a form of psychotherapy.</li>
 </ul>
<h3>


Phases of sleep</h3>
<p>
There are five phases of sleep in a sleep cycle:</p>
<ol>
<li>Stage 1 - light sleep, eyes move slowly, and muscle activity slows.This stage forms 4-5% of total sleep</li>
<li>Stage 2 - eye movement stops and brain waves (fluctuations of electrical activity that can be measured by electrodes) become slower, with occasional bursts of rapid waves called sleep spindles.
 This stage forms 45-55% of total sleep</li>
<li>Stage 3 - extremely slow brain waves called delta waves begin to appear, interspersed with smaller, faster waves. 4-6% of total sleep</li>
<li>Stage 4 - the brain produces delta waves almost exclusively. It is very difficult to wake someone during stages 3 and 4, which together are called "deep sleep."
 There is no eye movement or muscle activity. People awakened while in deep sleep do not adjust immediately and often feel groggy and disoriented for several minutes after they wake up.
 This forms 12-15% of total sleep.</li>
<li>Stage 5 - REM - breathing becomes more rapid, irregular and shallow, eyes jerk rapidly in various directions, and limb muscles become temporarily paralyzed. Heart rate increases, blood pressure rises, and males develop penile erections.
 When people awaken during REM sleep, they often describe bizarre and illogical tales - dreams. Forms 20-25% of total sleep time.</li>
<h2 id="2">
 What are dreams?
</h2>
Dreams are a universal human experience that can be described as a state of consciousness characterized by sensory, cognitive and emotional occurrences during sleep. The dreamer has reduced control over the content, visual images and activation of the memory.

There is no cognitive state that has been as extensively studied and yet as misunderstood as much as dreaming.
Reports of dreams tend to be full of emotional and vivid experiences that contain themes, concerns, dream figures, objects, etc. that correspond closely to waking life. These elements create a novel "reality" out of seemingly nothing, producing an experience with a lifelike timeframe and lifelike connections.<br /> <br />

<h3> Nightmares </h3>
<p>
Nightmares are distressing dreams that cause the dreamer to feel a number of disturbing emotions. Common feelings include fear and anxiety.

Nightmares or bad dreams occur in both adults and children and can be caused by:

</p>
<ul>
<li>Stress</li>
<li>Fear</li>
<li>Trauma</li>
<li>Emotional problems</li>
<li>Illness</li>
<li>Use of certain medications or drugs</li>
<h2 id ="3">
Can dreams predict future?</h2>
<p>Some dreams may seem to predict future events. Experts suggest that when this happens, it is usually due to coincidence, a false memory, or the unconscious connecting together known information.<br />
</p>&nbsp;
Dreams may help people to learn more about their feelings, beliefs, and values. Images and symbols that appear in dreams will have meanings and connections that are specific to each person.<br />
</p>
<p>People looking to make sense of their dreams should think about what each part of the dreams mean to them. Books or guides that give specific, universal meanings to images and symbols may not be useful.
</p>
<p>
Dreams emerge from the unconscious and occur in the Theta Brainwave state. In this state, we are open to receive insights/information from the subconscious. In the deeper state of Delta, our minds are passive and therefore can pick up cues from the energy of people, places, present day or future situations from what Jung referred to as the collective unconscious. Tapping into this collective mind is a rich source of information, guidance and spiritual directives.

<br />&nbsp;
Out of all your dreams, those that emanate from the spiritual realms have the most transformative effect. These dreams are so compelling, so vivid that you cannot dismiss them and the details of such dreams remain with you for years. These dreams are powerful in their intent to transform you, to reveal amazing and profound things about yourself and the world. I've had a few of them over the years, which have left me with feelings of awe and wonder.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
On occasion, a high being may appear in your dreams to advise, console and empower you. You might hear the name of your angel, or have a premonition or see your spirit guides. I have found over the years that dreams either reveal your potential or predict what is to come. How these two possibilities manifest in dream-time is different for everyone.

<h3> Evidence for Dreams Predicting the Future </h3>
<p> One study was carried out in the 1960s by a psychologist named John Barker. Following an incident in Aberfan, Wales, in which many people were killed when a mud slide crushed a school following a mining operation that had piled its waste on a hillside, the psychologist wondered if the large-scale event had been predicted by anyone in the country. Thus he appealed via newspapers for anyone who had had a relevant premonition to get in touch, and had 60 responses almost all of which were reports of dreams that had predicted the event. One particularly startling case was reported by the parents of one of the children killed in the catastrophe who reportedly had dreamed that he 'couldn't go to school' as a result of the school being 'gone' because it was 'covered in black stuff'.
</p>

<p>In a survey it was found that it is quite common for people to believe their dreams could predict future events and that most people had experienced this at some time. However again this can be explained through memory biases and chance. The jumbled nature of dreams also makes it relatively simple to find connections between dreams and reality. </p>
<img src ="Images/predict.gif" alt="predict" style="width:400px;height:270px;" />
<br />
<p>This theory is supported by many stories of people predicting disasters and their own deaths, and a lot of circumstantial evidence. Almost all of us have at some point had a dream that we believe has come true, have had some very convincing experience of deja vu or know someone else who has seemingly made an incredible premonition based on a dream. And in fact there are some studies that seem to suggest this to be possible as well.</p>
<h2 id="4">
Why are dreams hard to remember?</h2>
<p>Researchers estimate that 5 minutes after a dream, people have forgotten 50 percent of its content, increasing to 90 percent another 5 minutes later. Most dreams are entirely forgotten by the time someone wakes up.
</p><p>
It is not known precisely why dreams are so hard to remember. However, there are several steps that people can take to improve their dream recall. These include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Waking up naturally and not with an alarm</li><br />
<li>Focusing on the dream as much as possible upon waking</li><br />
<li>Writing down as much about the dream as possible upon waking</li><br />
<li>Making recording dreams a routine</li><br /></ul>
<img src="Images/d2.jpg" alt="why can't remember" style="width:400px;height:270px;" />
<h3> Dream-lag</h3>
<p>Have you ever noticed that often the images, experiences or people that emerge in dreams are images, experiences or people you have seen recently?</p>
<p>Frequently, details from a dream have been seen before, perhaps the previous day or a week prior to the dream. Recalling something from a week ago is known as the "dream-lag effect." The idea is that certain types of experiences take a week to be encoded into long-term memory, and some of the images from the consolidation process will appear in a dream</p>
<p>The dream-lag effect has been reported in REM but not NREM stage 2 dreams. These results may provide evidence for a 7-day sleep-dependent memory consolidation process that is specific to REM sleep, and would highlight the importance of REM sleep for emotional memory consolidation</p>
